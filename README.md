## Use Cases

Here are some common use cases for the Hubstaff v1 API client.

First configure the ``config.php`` with your ``APP_TOKEN``, ``email`` and ``password``.

### List users

List all users and organization or project memberships for each user.

```php

include("hubstaff.php");
$hubstaff = new hubstaff();
user = $hubstaff.users(true, true)

# => {"users": [{ "id":..., "organanizations": ["id":...], "projects": ["id":...]}]}

```

### Find a specific user

Users can be looked up by their ``user_id``.

```php

include("hubstaff.php");
$hubstaff = new hubstaff();
json_data = $hubstaff.find_user(61188)

# => {"user": { "id":...}}

```
